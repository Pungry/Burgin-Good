## Description

This is a fun little Heroku app that'll let you keep track of the burgers you've eaten, and the burgers you want to eat.

## Installation

This is a heroku app so no installation is necessary.

## Usage

To use the program, you'll just need to type in a burger you've wanted so badly you've downloaded a program to remember you want to eat it into the "Add A Burger" field. From there, just click the "Add Burger" button to add it to the "Burgers That Are Not Eaten" list. Once you've finally eaten that mouth-watering burger, click the "Eat Time" button next to the burger in order to mark it off as eaten, and it'll go into the "Burgers That Have Been Eaten" list. I suppose this could be used as a to-do list if you're alright with the burger theme, as well.

## License

Hey, this thing is free for you to use. Just don't use it to commit warcrimes is all I ask.
